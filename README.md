# Eulogy via Motherboard

Code repository for my project _Eulogy via Motherboard, 2024_.

Due to github pushing issues I had to reupload my whole repository, which in turn deleted my push history for the project.

Please see below for screenshots of my various file dates - to support proving my consistent working on the project.

In general, the approach I took to this project was to scan and amass my collections first, creating my assets before looking at creating my site to house it afterwards.
